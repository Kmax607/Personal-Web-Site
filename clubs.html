    <h2>Ski Club</h2>
    <p>The PSU Ski Club is University Parkâ€™s student-run recreational ski club. With over 400 members, it's larger and more active than ever before. The club holds campus events, socials, and provides opportunities for skiing. Trips are organized to resorts on the east and west coasts, including Vermont, Tremblant, Jackson Hole, and Salt Lake City. This year, the club plans to organize several trips to Vermont, a winter break trip to Canada, and a spring break trip out west. We aim to offer the best trips at the lowest prices possible, including large trip packages and small weekend and day trips. While primarily focused on skiing, the club also fosters a social atmosphere for members to meet new people and get involved on campus. Participation in events like THON is encouraged. Members can also get involved in club administration and help plan trips and socials.</p>
